# terraform-aws-icon-prep-basic

All in one module to deploy a P-Rep node for ICON. Best called from [github.com/insight-infrastructure/terragrunt-aws-icon](github.com/insight-infrastructure/terragrunt-aws-icon) as there are a lot of variables you need to fill in and you need to reference a playbook in [github.com/insight-infrastructure/ansible-icon-prep](github.com/insight-infrastructure/terragrunt-aws-icon).
